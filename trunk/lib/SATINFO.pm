my $generic_desc='GPS Block 2 was the operational system, following the demonstration system comprised of Block 1 (Navstar 1 - 11) spacecraft. These spacecraft were 3-axis stabilized, nadir pointing using reaction wheels. Dual solar arrays supplied 710 watts of power. They used S-band (SGLS) communications for control and telemetry and UHF cross-link between spacecraft. The payload consisted of two L-band navigation signals at 1575.42 MHz (L1) and 1227.60 MHz (L2). Each spacecraft carried 2 rubidium and 2 cesium clocks and nuclear detonation detection sensors. Built by Rockwell Space Systems for the US Air Force, the spacecraft measured 5.3 m across with solar panels deployed and had a design life of 7.5 years.';

But it retained the prerogative to degrade the accuracy at selected locations when necessary. Also known as PRN20 (in GPS parlance), it replaced the failing PRN14 in Slot E-1.
