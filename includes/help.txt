To start WARCARRIER, first you must start Airodump-ng in this directory
and pass "--write myout" to it. Make sure there are no other "myout.*"
files in here. 
Next, just run ./warcarrier to begin scanning.

This is ALPHA code that should not be released yet and still under heavy development.

Thank you for testing!
