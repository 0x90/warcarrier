#summary This is the manual and how-to.

= Installation =

===dependencies (in Debian)===
This should get us going:
{{{
cpan -i JSON::XS
cpan -i Curses::UI
apt-get install libpcap-dev iw build-essential sqlite-dev
# some of the above names may need changed do apt-cache search fo them
mkdir /tmp/aircrack && cd /tmp/aircrack
svn co http://trac.aircrack-ng.org/svn/trunk/ new
cd new
make && make install
}}}

===Starting her up===

Just make sure the terminal is wide enough:

{{{
tar vzxf warcarrier-*.tar.gz
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor # should make mon0 - change wlan0 to your device
./warcarrier -d mon0 - outputfile
}}}

You can also do {{{ ./wcstartup.sh }}}

===House Cleaning +++important===

If the Application stops for no apparent reason - this is the result of Curses::UI, the daemons won't runaway! They will be reconnected to Warcarrier upon restart. If you restart warcarrier, it will not spwan a second process for Airodump-NG, Bluetooth, or GPS. It uses the environment (ps aux) to check if they are already running - please ignore the second "Please wait..." status message that will display, this is just the application checking for dependencies.<br />If, however, you do not want to restart Warcarrier, you should use the Warcarrier cleanup utility {{{ wcclean }}}

This utility takes the argument (all|logs|sys|proc)
 * all - stops ALL runaway processes and removes ALL logs
 * logs - removes all logs and pcap files
 * sys - removes all system buffer files created during use
 * proc - stops ALL processes used or not used but shared by Warcarrier
