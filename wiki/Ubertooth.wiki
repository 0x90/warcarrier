Warcarrier now has support for the Ubertooth Bluetooth (spectrum analyzer functionality only) using Dragorn's SpecTools. I use spectool_raw to poll the device for the raw dBm values of RSSI (received signal strength Indication) levels. Here is an example of output:

{{{
-100 -97 -100 -88 -97 -99 -86 -97 -100 ... 
}}}

These values are preprocessed and dBm values according to the spectools Author himself. I take them and draw lines using the difference in (dBm_MAX - RSSI_dBm) yielding (from above output)

{{{
0 3 0 12 3 1 14 3 0
}}}

The lines are then made like so:

{{{
---              |
--         |     |
-90dBm     |     |
-          |     |
--         |     |
---        |     |
--         |     |
-95dBm     |     |
-          |     |
--         |     |
--         |     |
---      | | |   | |
--       | | |   | |
-100dBm _| | |_| | |_
        2400MHz 2406MHz ...
}}}

Then I simply reverse them into spaces with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mdxi/Curses-UI-0.9609/">Curses::UI</a>'s {{{ -reverse=>1 }}} attribute to the Label object and display them with the corresponding value to the left and a small key in the top right with color coded lines.

Each bar is a Curses::UI Label object, which is kind of clunky, but works. So to do this, I used simple logic/magic to convert these bars into one-line bars in a new array, which I invented with a dry-erase marker on my large bathroom mirror.
